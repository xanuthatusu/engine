A game engine made in C++
=========================

## To build
```bash
cmake --build .
```

## To Run
```bash
cd bin/
./Main
```

### Notes
You have to be in the bin directory to run the application because of my simple way of opening shader files. I plan to update this in the future to be more user friendly.
